# CSGO-External
A very basic external hack made to learn more about C++ and memory manipulation in a fun way. Pressing Q toggles the wallbot (uses basic paint commands, no writing to the game's memory), and holding E enables the aimbot to the closest enemy. 

There is also a very effective bhop script bound to key number 9, you can change that to the space bar if you want but I find it is not as effective when both the jump button and the bhop button are the same key.
